# PackMan
# Shit-tier package manager/freezer/etc, for LineageOS
# A serious work in progress.

# Goals
# - Easily freeze and defrost apps using LOS built-in components
# - See which packages are available on the system
# There are a lot of issues with the way LOS manages packages.
# I have homework to do...
